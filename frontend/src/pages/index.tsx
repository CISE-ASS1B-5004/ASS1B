      <h2>About SPEED</h2>
      <p>
        SPEED, short for Software Practice Empirical Evidence Database, is a
        collaborative platform created as part of CISE Group 5004&apos;s
        Assignment 1B. Our primary goal is to provide a centralized repository
        for empirical evidence related to software development practices.

          extract vital information such as abstracts, methodologies, and
          references.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Database Entry:</strong> The extracted information is then
          entered into the SPEED database, making it easily accessible for users
          interested in researching and exploring software development
          practices.
