# Software Practice Empirical Evidence Database (SPEED)
*CISE Group 5004 - Assignment 1B*

## Introduction
Welcome to the Software Practice Empirical Evidence Database (SPEED) readme file. SPEED is a collaborative platform created as part of CISE Group 5004's Assignment 1B. Its primary purpose is to serve as a central repository for empirical evidence related to software development practices.

## Features
SPEED provides the following key features:

- **Article Submission**: Anyone from the public can propose articles to be included in SPEED by submitting links to these articles. This crowdsourcing approach allows for a diverse range of empirical evidence to be considered.

- **Moderation**: Staff from SERC (Software Engineering Research Center) act as moderators. They review the proposed articles for quality, relevance, and duplication. If an article passes moderation, it proceeds to analysis.

- **Analysis**: SERC staff members, known as Analysts, read and analyze the approved articles. They extract relevant information, including abstracts, methodologies, and references.

- **Database Entry**: The extracted information is then entered into the SPEED database, making it accessible to users for research and exploration of software development practices.
